<p>Unfortunately there are so many flavors of linux that it's hard to cover all of them here.</p><p>Using Ubuntu, I found the official docs from Docker actually pretty on the point:</p><p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/</a></p><p>After running through them, if you still have troubles getting Docker Started, then let me know in the course Q&amp;A or the Facebook Group. I don't have Ubuntu installed, but I&nbsp;can manage to get access to an Ubuntu Linux and screencast the install-process.</p>
